Thoughts so far:

* My recommendation is, if you have the option of, instead of reading, listening to a *memoir/autobiography* read by its author (not sure how well this works with other literary forms), you should do that. As with David Lynch's **Room to Dream**, I found extra levels of enjoyment from consuming this as an oral history in the author's voice, laden with their particular mannerisms and emphasis; I imagine the book version would be less rich for the lack of those dimensions.
* The book works well as an often-funny, always-entertaining first-person chronicle and chronology of the band's experiences during a creatively fertile but struggle-filled period. It doesn't go much deeper than that, though, into the bigger ideas, drivers, and psychosocial undercurrents of the music. Which is fair enough; Hook's focus at the time was channeling inchoate anger into bass riffs that were essential components of the group's music, as well as (to his great lament) driving the van back and forth to gigs, but his contribution was not that of a deeply-thought-out organizing set of principles or aesthetic behind Joy Division's sound. For first person accounts of that, you'd have to hear from Ian Curtis, and maybe Martin Hannett ... alas.
* An oddly enjoyable aspect here is "Hooky"'s constant aggrieved jabs at his erstwhile bandmate, Bernard Sumner (nicknamed "Barney"). "Oddly" because of all the group's personalities, Sumner's archetype seems to match my own most closely (introverted, a bit fussy and uptight, with an experimental and perfectionistic bent). There's a perverse fun in listening to Hook describe a dust-up with Barney, hearing the latter's actions described, and thinking "that's probably exactly how I'd have behaved in the same situation. I'd have rightly been called a dick, but still, I'd have had my reasons." It's easy for me to imagine some of Hook's complaints about Barney running through the minds of those who've had frustrations with me in the past. At the same time, I've experienced plenty of my own frustrations with the Hooky's of the world, so ... c'est la vie.
