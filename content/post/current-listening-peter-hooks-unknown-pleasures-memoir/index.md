Thoughts so far:

* My recommendation is, if you have the option of, instead of reading, listening to a *memoir/autobiography* read by its author (not sure how well this works with other literary forms), you should do that. As with David Lynch's **Room to Dream**, I found extra levels of enjoyment from consuming this as an oral history in the author's voice, and laden with their particular mannerisms and emphasis; I imagine the book version would be less rich for the lack of those dimensions.

  This works great as an often-funny, always-entertaining first-person chronicle and chronology of the band's experiences during a creatively fertile but struggle-filled period. It doesn't go much deeper than that, though, into the deeper ideas, drivers, and surrounding forces and context behind the music. Which is fair enough; Hook's focus at the time was channeling inchoate anger into bass riffs that were essential components of the group's music, as well as (to his great lament) driving the van back and forth to gigs, but his contribution was not that of a deeply-thought-out organizing set of principles or aesthetic behind Joy Division's sound. For first person accounts of that, you'd have to hear from Ian Curtis, and maybe Martin Hannett ... alas.
