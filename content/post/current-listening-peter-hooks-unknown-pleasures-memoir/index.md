Thoughts so far:

* Recommendation: if you have the option of not reading, but listening to a *memoir/autobiography* recounted by its author (not sure how well this works with other literary forms), you should do that. As with David Lynch's **Room to Dream**, I found greater levels of enjoyment from consuming this as an oral history in the author's voice, laden with their particular mannerisms and emphasis; I imagine the print version would be less rich for lack of those dimensions.
* The book works as an often-funny, always-entertaining first-person chronicle of the band's experiences during a creatively fertile but harrowing, struggle-filled period. It doesn't go much deeper than that, though, into the bigger ideas, drivers, and psychosocial undercurrents of the music. Which is fair enough; Hook's focus at the time was channeling inchoate anger into bass riffs that were essential components of the group's music, as well as (to his great lament) driving the van back and forth to gigs; his contribution was not that of a deeply-considered organizing set of principles or aesthetic behind Joy Division's sound. For first person accounts of that, you'd have to hear from Ian Curtis, and maybe Martin Hannett ... alas.
* An oddly enjoyable aspect here is "Hooky"'s constant aggrieved jabs at his erstwhile bandmate, Bernard Sumner (nicknamed "Barney"). "Oddly" because of all the group's personalities, Sumner's archetype seems to match most closely with my own (introverted, a bit fussy and uptight, with experimental and perfectionistic inclinations). There's a perverse fun in listening to Hook describe his dust-ups with Barney, hearing the latter's actions described, and thinking "that's probably exactly how I'd have behaved in the same situation. I'd have been called a dick and they'd have been right, but still, I'd have had my reasons." It's easy for me to imagine some of Hook's complaints about Barney running through the minds of those who've had frustrations with me in the past. At the same time, I've experienced plenty of my own frustrations with the Hooky's of the world, so ... *c'est la vie.*
* As the book marches inexorably toward its tragic conclusion, a grim refrain appears and seems to increase in frequency. One night it's, *the lighting guy turned on a strobe, causing Ian to have a violent fit on stage.* The next it's, *Ian had been stressed and under-slept, and he ended up collapsing into the drum kit during that night's set; we had to drop our instruments and cradle his head as he shook wildly, while we endured a rain of insults from the audience.* Usually followed not by, "After a visit to the doctor," or "After some time spent recovering," but instead an immediate recounting of the next night's medical emergency, typically occurring under much the same conditions that produced the previous one. It's so hard to read because you know what's coming, and you see so many off-ramps to avoiding that fate.
