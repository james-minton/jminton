With all due sympathies for those on the receiving end, I do get a ton of enjoyment from learning about  bizarre internet scams like the one featured in today’s New York Times. The most compelling hook for me in this niche true crime subgenre is when some sort of foul play is clearly involved, but the motivation, monetization strategy, and endgame are all far from evident, leaving space wide open for speculation. 

From the article, [Why on Earth Is Someone Stealing Unpublished Book Manuscripts?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/books/publishing-manuscripts-phishing-scam.html?referringSource=articleShare)

> Mr. Hannaham was just one of countless targets in a mysterious international phishing scam that has been tricking writers, editors, agents and anyone in their orbit into sharing unpublished book manuscripts. It isn’t clear who the thief or thieves are, or even how they might profit from the scheme. High-profile authors like Margaret Atwood and Ian McEwan have been targeted, along with celebrities like Ethan Hawke. But short story collections and works by little-known debut writers have been attacked as well, even though they would have no obvious value on the black market.

> In fact, the manuscripts do not appear to wind up on the black market at all, or anywhere on the dark web, and no ransoms have been demanded. When copies of the manuscripts get out, they just seem to vanish. So why is this happening?

Besides mysterious motives, there are other intriguing features that typify these scams: the often overwrought, Rube Goldbergian nature of some of these operations. And a weirder, seldom-discussed aspect, the one that grips me the most: the sometimes-surreal beauty of these scams' outward forms—almost always unintentional, as the motive is seldom other than money. But occasionally you see the same phenomenon as when, say, an intricate machine designed purely for function's sake transcends its makers' aims and becomes a work of art.

A great case in point, featuring all of these qualities (inscrutable motives, byzantine complexity, and inadvertent sublimity) is detailed in my favorite Reply All episode, [The Case of the Phantom Caller](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8ho3a). In this podcast, we learn of an elaborate phone scam which generates—almost as an incidental side effect—recorded artifacts which comprise an unnerving "found audio" collage reminiscent of a Burroughs-style cut-up piece. Amazingly, it sounds as if created by design—not unlike a lot of the experimental music I listened to in college. 

Somehow, the hosts spend most of the time examining the complex mechanics of this long-distance fraud, and very little marveling at its curious auditory fruits. But both of these elements combined make for an hour-long WTF? that still haunts me.
